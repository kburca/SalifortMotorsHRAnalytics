# SalifortMotorsHRAnalytics

The purpose of this data science project is to showcase my skill in Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

Uploaded in the repository are the markdown file, pickle files for the fit models, and executive summary. If you wish to run the markdown file, change the value of the `path` variable where the pickle files are stored and then, comment out the codes that fit the models to the training data and the codes for writing the the fit models to pickle files.
